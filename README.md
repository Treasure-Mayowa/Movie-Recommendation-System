# Movie Recommendation System
#### Description: A simple on-demand movie recommendation system


#### It is quite common to find yourself in this situation. It is Friday night, you're alone at home (or with friends) and it is time to just 'Netflix and Chill.' The popcorn's ready, the snacks are ready but wait... the movie isn't. You spend the next minutes scrolling through Netflix(or really any other streaming service) trying to figure out what to watch. Getting a movie to watch shouldn't be that complex and can be much easier.

#### Introducing the ***Movie Recommendation System***. Its purpose is to assist users in finding suitable movies to watch based on their preferences. It simplifies the process of choosing a movie by asking a few questions and generating personalized recommendations from a dataset of movies.

#### _Files_:
#### `project.py`: The main code file containing functions programmed to collect and process user input and provide the best possible movie recommendations. The code utilizes key modules like the re modules to match a pattern, the CSV module to access and read the CSV files, and the random module to randomise multiple movie options.

#### `movies.csv`: The foundation of the project, this CSV file contains movie data to aid the recommendation process. It contains key values to check and filter movie options based on the user input. Please note that the values in the file are not real and were simply generated for the project. :)

#### _Usage_:
#### To use the program, follow these steps:

#### Clone the repository using git clone.
#### Run the program and follow the prompts to answer simple questions.
#### Based on your responses, the program will recommend a movie for you to watch and enjoy!
